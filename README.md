A library for Video core items processing - frames, pixels, colors, ...

Specs writing just started by 2022-01-22.  

Devs have started in the meantime. Have a look to branch `dev` for the 
last stable merge **which should not be considered as a release** but as 
the latest stable state of current devs.  

Developments currently in progress are kept isolated in dedicated branches 
created from branch `dev`.
